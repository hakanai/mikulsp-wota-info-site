Every idol has to have skills and training is how you raise them.

Training courses cost money and AP as well as potentially degrading Miku's condition.

Gathering 20 friends unlocks the highest level of training courses, so this is the recommended minimum number of friends to keep.

The actual rewards you get for taking each course are randomised. On some days, things seem to go better than others, but in all likelihood this is just pure luck of the draw.

## Training courses

The following table lists the available training courses.

## Effect of training on condition

Training introduces a chance of moving from one condition to the next one down. The chance of this is around 50%, meaning a 50% chance of lowering the condition and a 50% chance of no effect at all. Condition will recover as described on the [Idol](/idol) page.
