I started playing _Hatsune Miku: Live Stage Producer_.

It's kind of like _THE iDOLM@STER_, except there are only a couple of songs (until you fork out money),
only one mini-game (for live shows) and only one idol. But hey, the one idol it _does_ have is the cutest!

At the time I started playing, the sole wiki in Japanese was devoid of any useful information about the game mechanics,
so I started this site. I am incorporating any information which the wiki shows before we have discovered it for ourselves,
but in contrast with my site for [THE iDOLM@STER 2](http://imas2.wota.info/)
(which is just a straight translation of an existing wiki), for the most part, this site is original research.

If you want to help, for the time being you should track down ~~Omochikaeri on Rizon IRC~~ @HakanaiVR on X.
